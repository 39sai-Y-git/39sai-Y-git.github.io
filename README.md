<p>Saien: Hello, Mr Wise. Thank you for taking the time to speak to me. How are you?
<br>Wise: Hi there. I'm doing well, thank you for asking. And yourself?
<br>Saien: I'm great, thanks. So, today I'll be asking you a few questions regarding your community. You don't need to think too hard, just say what comes to mind. First, how would you describe your role in your community?
<br>Wise: Hm...well, I suppose I would say that I have a...supportive role? I try to help out and guide others whenever I get the chance.
<br>Saien: Hmm. That's quite nice of you. We all need that pillar of support in our lives.
<br>Wise: You're right. We do need support from others. Especially when things get tough.
<br>Saien: So, Wise, do you know what Ubuntu is?
<br>Wise: Ubuntu? Yeah, I've heard the term before. It's a concept from certain cultures that basically means 'humanity' or 'humanity among humans'.
<br>Saien: I'm surprised. It's not a well known concept around here. So, is that your understanding of it?
<br>Wise: Yep, that's my understanding.
<br>Saien: Great, so, what does Ubuntu mean to you, personally?
<br>Wise: Hmm...to me, I think of it as a way of connecting with others. It's about helping each other out and being there for each other when we need it...I think it's a beautiful concept, really.
<br>Saien: Yes, I agree. Now, think about your own day-to-day life. How would you say Ubuntu plays a part in it?
<br>Wise: Hm, well...I try to be there for my friends and family when they need me. If someone's having a hard time, I try to offer support...In a way, I think of it as my personal mission to help make sure everyone's okay.
<br>Saien: Your personal mission? I must say...that's quite amazing. More people should try to be like you. It's a shame most have forgotten how important a community is.
<br>Wise: Yeah ... it really is. I think in today's society people have become more disconnected from one another...and I don't think that's a good thing.
<br>Saien: Yeah, neither do I...So, were you brought up in a community that you'd say valued Ubuntu?
<br>Wise: Yes, actually. I was raised in a community that put a lot of value on support and cooperation. It was a...close-knit community, I think, and everyone looked after each other.
<br>Saien: So, you'd say that Ubuntu had a direct influence on your life back then? Or was it more indirect?
<br>Wise: It had a direct influence. It was...ingrained in the way we lived our lives back then. It was just...understood, you know? That we all had to support each other.
<br>Saien: なるほど (I see). I'm starting to get the picture of the kind of community you lived in...
<br>Wise: Yeah...it was something special, I think. It's just...it's hard to find that kind of community these days, you know?
<br>Saien: Hm, which brings me to my next question. What would you say about the community you live in now?
<br>Wise: It's...different, for sure. I mean, it's not bad. It's just...less close-knit, I suppose...less connected, if that makes sense.
<br>Saien: Yes, that makes sense. Still, it's better than others. Can you tell me a little about the people who live here, and maybe a little on the community as a whole?
<br>Wise: Well, the people here are all pretty nice. There's a strong sense of community, still...and it's a diverse group of individuals. Some of them are introverted, some are extroverted. We all have different interests and hobbies. But...as for the community itself? It's...decent, I suppose. Nothing too special.
<br>Saien: What do you mean?
<br>Wise: I mean...it doesn't feel as tight-knit as the old community. There's no real shared sense of community pride or identity...it's more of a simple living situation, rather than a true "community." I just feel...a bit disconnected, I guess.
<br>Saien: I think I get it. It's kinda like everyone is just doing their own thing?
<br>Wise: Exactly. People just go about their own lives. They have their own friends and interests. It's a very individualistic type of environment, rather than a communal one.
<br>Saien: Hm, yeah, looks like it...So, Ubuntu isn't fully practiced here. Where does the community fall short, I wonder?
<br>Wise: Well, to be honest...it's the lack of connection. There's no real shared sense of purpose or belonging. People seem to live here just for the sake of it. It feels a lot more like a temporary home, rather than a true community...and yeah, the lack of Ubuntu is definitely a factor. There's no real sense of collective support or care for one another.
<br>Saien: So, if this community had to adopt the values of Ubuntu, how would things change? What would that look like?
<br>Wise: Well...for starters, there would be a strong sense of mutual support and cooperation. People would look out for one another, and share their skills and resources... There'd be a real feeling of belonging, you know? A sense of "we're in this together." People would care about each others well-being, and make an effort to connect with one another on a deeper level.
<br>Saien: That sounds like the ideal, right? It just sucks that the communities that do follow Ubuntu like that tend to be in a poor condition, if you know what I mean...
<br>Wise: Yeah, I know what you mean. Communities that follow the principles of Ubuntu often tend to be in impoverished, disadvantaged areas...It's kind of sad, when you think about it.
<br>Saien: Yeah, it is...but I digress. I have a more serious question for you now...
<br>Wise: Go ahead. I'm listening.
<br>Saien: Do you think that Ubuntu has the potential to be used as an excuse for people to mistreat or abuse others?
<br>Wise: Well...yes, I suppose it does. Like any set of values, it can be manipulated and twisted to suit someone's purposes. In fact, I've seen it happen.
<br>Saien: I think we all have heard of at lease one instance of someone using Ubuntu for...something horrendous. But...thank you Mr Wise. I have a few questions of my own now. Everything you answered so far...the questions were given to me.
<br>Wise: Yeah? You have your own questions you want to ask me?
<br>Saien: Firstly, can you recall one situation where you wished Ubuntu was more of a thing in this community, because it would have helped to resolve the issue?
<br>Wise: Hmm...I have, actually. There was this one time when a member of the community was going through a tough period. They were going through a lot of personal struggles, and they were feeling overwhelmed. There was just an overall lack of support and care from the rest of the community, you know? They just weren't really there for this person when they needed them.
<br>Saien: This person, the reached out to the community? Or did they stay silent?
<br>Wise: They reached out. They just wanted a bit of support, you know?...and the community just...well...It kind of failed them. It's just...it's situations like this that make me wish that the community was more unified. If the community had followed the principles of Ubuntu, I think things would have been very different.
<br>Saien: It's like what you said earlier, sometimes we really, really need that support from our communities. It can go a long way.
<br>Wise: Exactly. We all have our rough moments, right? The times when we really need someone to catch us. That's what community is for, y'know? To pick you up when you fall...but it's not like that here. The community just...feels disconnected. It feels like we're all a bunch of people living side-by-side, rather than a true community. It's just...sad, really.
<br>Saien: Yeah, it is. I have one more question.
<br>Wise: Sure, ask away.
<br>Saien: I know you said you want to help others in your community, and that's great. But, if you had a problem, and needed help...would you be able to call upon the community?
<br>Wise: ...I'm not going to lie. If I was going through a rough patch and needed help here...I don't think I'd turn to the community. Even if I did reach out, and try to connect....I don't think I'd find the support I need. I'd...I'd probably keep it to myself.
<br>Saien: Why do you think this is the case?
<br>Wise: Honestly, I think there's a lack of collective pride. Most people here are only concerned with themselves...and it's not really a judgement thing. It's just the way they're wired. They're not really the type to reach out or connect with others. And even if they did, I don't think they'd follow the traditional values of Ubuntu...So yeah. I just...don't think I'd find support here.
<br>Saien: Mr Wise, you've given me a lot of insight into the short comings of this community in terms of Ubuntu. I'm very grateful. Is there anything else you want to add before we leave?
<br>Wise: No, I think I'm good.
<br>Saien: Alright, then. Thank you for your time.</p>
