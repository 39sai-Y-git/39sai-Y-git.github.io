<p>Saien: Hello, Mr Wise. Thank you for taking the time to speak to me. How are you?
<br>Wise: Hi there. I'm doing well, thank you for asking. And yourself?
<br>Saien: I'm great, thanks. So, today I'll be asking you a few questions regarding your community. You don't need to think too hard, just say what comes to mind. First, how would you describe your role in your community?
